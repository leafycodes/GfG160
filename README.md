# ðŸš€ GFG 160-Day Challenge (160 Problems in 160 Days)

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository documents my **GfG 160** challenge, where I solve **160 GeeksforGeeks (GFG) problems in 160 days** exclusively in **C++** (to strengthen my C++ skills).

- **Why C++?** Iâ€™m focusing on mastering C++ for DSA and competitive programming.
- **Java?** I solve Java-based problems on LeetCode separately.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
âœ” Improve **problem-solving skills** & **C++ proficiency**
âœ” Cover **key DSA topics** (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
âœ” Maintain consistency
